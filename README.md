## Calabash Sandbox

To get up and running as fast as possible to use Calabash, we recommend you
use our Ruby Sandbox. The sandbox is a pre-configured ruby environment that
has everything you need to start exploring Calabash and running tests right away.
The sandbox is configured with the same version of Ruby running on Xamarin's
Test Cloud, so you don't need to worry about ruby compatibilities.

## System Requirements

Calabash Sandbox requires one of the following operating systems:
- OSX Yosemite
- OSX El Capitan
- Windows 10

The sandbox is not officially supported on other OS versions.

### Installation

See [System Requirements](https://github.com/calabash/install#system-requirements) above.

##### OSX
```shell
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calabash/install/master/install-osx.sh | bash
```

##### Windows

In an administrator Powershell:

```powershell
set-executionpolicy unrestricted
```

then
```powershell
(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calabash/install/master/install-windows.ps1") | iex
```

Post-installation, execute the following in an administrator Powershell:
```powershell
set-executionpolicy restricted
```

When installation completes, you should see something like the following:

```shell
Done! Installed:
calabash-android:   0.8.2
xamarin-test-cloud: 2.0.2
Execute 'calabash-sandbox' to get started!
```

You can execute `calabash-sandbox update` at any time to fetch the latest gems.

### Usage

When you execute `calabash-sandbox`, your Terminal window will open the
sandbox environment. To leave the sandbox and return the terminal to its
previous state, simply type `exit`.

While in the sandbox, you will have access to all of the gems you need to
start writing tests and submitting to Test Cloud. To get started, you could
run

```shell
$ calabash-ios gen #OSX only
```

or

```shell
$ calabash-android gen
```

For more information on Calabash, please see the [Calabash documentation](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/calabash/).

### Configuring/Customizing the environment

By default, the sandbox will ignore any existing ruby setup you have on your
machine, including installed gems. The sandbox shell is launched with a `PATH`,
`GEM_PATH`, and `GEM_HOME` that reference the pre-configured sandbox environment
(which is installed to `$HOME/.calabash/sandbox`).

#### Installing new gems

If you install new gems while running in the sandbox, they will be installed
in the sandbox's `GEM_HOME` and thus not be available outside of the sandbox.

#### Building native extensions on Windows

When installing gems that build native extensions on Windows you may get the following error:

```shell
ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.
```

To resolve this you must provide the Calabash sandbox installation of ruby with the RubyInstaller Development Kit:

1. Download DevKit from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ making sure you get the version for 32bit versions of Ruby 2.0 and above
- Install DevKit into `C:\DevKit`
- Launch the Calabash sandbox `calabash-sandbox`
- Execute `cd C:\DevKit\ && ruby dk.rb init`
- Add the following line (replacing `<user>` with your user directory) to `C:\DevKit\config.yml` if it doesnâ€™t already exist:
  ```
  - C:\Users\<user>\.calabash\sandbox\Rubies\ruby-2.1.6-p336
  ```
- Execute `ruby dk.rb install`

#### Restoring the sandbox

If you have altered your sandbox environment in a way you don't like and want
to restore it to the original state, just run these commands:

##### OSX:
```shell
$ rm -r ${HOME}/.calabash/sandbox
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asifrepo/calabash-sandbox-install/master/install-osx.sh | bash

```

##### Windows:
In a powershell,
```powershell
rm -r -fo "${env:USERPROFILE}\.calabash\sandbox"
```

In an administrator Powershell:

```powershell
set-executionpolicy unrestricted
```

then
```powershell
(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calabash/install/master/install-windows.ps1") | iex
```

Post-installation, execute the following in an administrator Powershell:
```powershell
set-executionpolicy restricted
```


## Troubleshooting

### "/usr/local/bin is not writeable"

This is a common error on a fresh install of OSX.

The script attempts to install the sandbox executable to `/usr/local/bin` so that
it can be easily invoked from the command line. However, if you don't have
write permissions in that dir, the install script will not be able to move
the script there. You can still run it locally by executing

```shell
$ ./calabash-sandbox
```

from the same directory as you ran the install script.

If you'd like to install it globally, either have an administrator move the
`calabash-sandbox` executable to somewhere in your `PATH` or modify your
`.bash_profile`, `.profile`, `.zsh` etc. to find `calabash-sandbox` in your
`PATH`.  You should not run the install script with `sudo`.

### I ran the install script with `sudo`


```shell
$ sudo rm -r ${HOME}/.calabash/sandbox
$ sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/calabash-sandbox
$ sudo rm -f ./calabash-sandbox
```

Run the install script again, this time _without sudo_.
